    Dear <%= @ref_first_name %> <%= @ref_last_name %>,
    <br /><br />
    <%= @applicant_name %> has just applied for an exciting missions opportunity this 
    summer with Campus for Christ and has suggested that we contact you as a 
    reference. If you could take some time and fill out a recommendation for this 
    applicant, we can continue with the application process.  The application 
    materials will then be reviewed and a decision will be given as soon as possible.
    <br /><br />
    In case you don't have time to finish the reference form in one sitting, we allow 
    you to save and come back to it whenever it is convenient for you to finish.
    <br /><br />
    The reference form is on our secure web site.  Just use the link below to go 
    directly to the reference form for  <%= @applicant_name %>.  Your reference will 
    be kept confidential, and the applicant will not be able to read the information 
    you share with us.  The insight that you provide will be very helpful in determining 
    a decision about this applicant's summer!<br /><br />
    You may contact the applicant by phone at  (<%=@applicant_phone%>) or by email at (<%=@applicant_email%>).
    <br /><br />
    If you would prefer not to participate, please notify the applicant yourself so 
    that they can take you off of their reference list.  If you would prefer to fill 
    out a paper reference form, please ask the applicant to provide you one.
    <br /><br />
    Please do not forward this email to the applicant, so that they do not receive 
    the link for editing their own reference form.<br /><br />
    Thank you very much.<br /><br />
    Sincerely,<br />
    Campus for Christ<br />
    projects@campusforchrist.org<br/><br /><br />
    
    
    Please use the following link.  
    The link should be all in one line, so if it is split up into more than one line,  
    you may need to copy the entire address (including both/all of the lines) into 
    your web browser's address bar.<br /><br />
    
    <a href="<%=@url%>"><%=@url %></a> <br /><br />
    
    You do not have to fill out the entire form at one time.  After you start filling 
    out the form, you may exit at any time and return later to finish.  Just use the 
    same link to return to the form.<br />
