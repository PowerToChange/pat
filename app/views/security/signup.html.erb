We are now using <A HREF="http://www.mygcx.org">Global ConneXion</A> (GCX) to authenticate users.  GCX is developed by the American Campus Crusade for Christ tech team, and is used by Campus Crusade ministries around the world.  <A HREF="http://technology.ccci.org/gcx/index.html">Read more about GCX here</A>.  Using GCX means more people can use the project tool, and you only need to remember their GCX login rather than separate credentials for each site.
