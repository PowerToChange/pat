<p>Note about international donors: International donations have three states -- pending, received, and invalid.  Pending means the donation was market down on you record of funds form, and Power to Change is waiting to receive the donation from the appropriate international country's headquarters.  Pending donation amounts are based on an estimated conversion rate.  When it is sent to Power to Change headquarters, the status will change to received, and the amount will be updated to the actual conversion rate used.  If there was an issue with the donation, such as an invalid cheque, the donation will go to invalid status and not count towards your total.  If a donation is invalid, you can inquire about it using an email below.</p>
